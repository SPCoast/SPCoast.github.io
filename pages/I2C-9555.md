overview: >
    
    A compliment to the [I2C-8574-IO] dual 8-bit board, the 9555 offers a 16 bit data path (2x 8-bit ports, port0 and port1)
    This board is slightly cheaper to build (1x 9555 chip -vs- 2x 8574 chips...), but slightly harder to use (unpacking 16 bit words into byte size chunks)
    
    This board was not updated to use IOB daughtercards...
