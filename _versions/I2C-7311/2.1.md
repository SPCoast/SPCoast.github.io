tagline: I2C MAX7311/7312-based IO Expander with 4x IOB daughterboard connections
overview: >
    
    Versions:
    
    
      * 1.0 - laid out for 7313 QSOP, found that the more desirable '11 and '12 chips are not available in QSOP.  '13 is not available in SSOP.
      * 2.0 - multiple silkscreen errors (still labeled as '13 even tho '11 package was used)
      * 2.1 - Same as v2.0, but board has carrier for "design for fabrication" optimization.  Fixed silkscreen name, change from '13 to '11
    
    Populating with '11 part means no external pullups are needed, '12 part requires external pull ups. 
    The board supports both variations; simply don't populate the resistors when using the 7311.
