overview: >
    
    An I2C slave board that drives 6x signal head drivers (effectively 3x IOB-Signal circuits)
    in a form factor that mimics the panelization spacing of the simple signal boards.
    
    This allows bulk testing after fabrication of an entire board in 2 (or 4) operations 
      * align a board with the pogo pins
      * press down on pins
      * observe the correct operation of the heads
         * mark any defective units
      * move panel to next set of contacts & repeat
