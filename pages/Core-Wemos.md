## doc

Based on cost and features, the WeMOS ESP8366 board is the next logical step up from the ProMini for my control point work.


Previous boards (Core-ArdIOShield, Core-ESP8266, Core-OAK, Core-PhotonIOShield and Core-Multi - not published here) were useful learning experiences,
but their limitations (ArdIOShield has no wifi, OAK is a failed KickStarter, Photon is expensive and aimed at a different user base, ...)
mean I won't be using them any more...
