tagline: Mounting adapter for active IR detector remote sensor
overview: >
    
    Designed for the Rolm RPR-220-photoreflector or equivalent IR transmitter/Detector
    
     * Drill a hole under the track / between the rails for the detector sensor 
     * Measure the roadbed depth and solder the sensor to the mounting plate such that the sensor does not extend up past the ties
     * solder a 4x wire harness - or a 1x4 header - to the mount, with the pins/wires facing down / away from the sensor
     * Use a screw to attach the mount under the layout
