release: yes
tagline: Core Field Unit Processor board using an ESP32 Dev Board with Wifi, BLE and a small OLED screen
overview: >
    
    A platform to prove out the ESP32 environment (maybe with circuit python) as a field unit implementation platform,
    allowing the software stack to be generalized and possibly based off of interpreted text file based data structures rather than customized C++ code.
    
    
    ESP32 - Geekcreit WROOM dev board & SSD1306 I2C OLED - Matrix LED displays removed.
    
    
    The 1.0 version integrated OLEDs were poor quality in practice; 2.0 brings
      * a different ESP32 - Geekcreit ESP32/Dev WROOM,
      * an external OLED - SSD1306 128x32 oe 128x64, which unfortunately covers the WiFi antennas and degrades performance.
      * external LED Matrix codeline displays with processor signals brought out to an RJ12 IO4 jack.
