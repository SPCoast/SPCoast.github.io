overview: >
    
    This design evolved from the Core-ArduinoShield sequence as it became obvious that
    the eBay ProMini clones were much cheaper than full sized Arduinos and their clones.
    
    
    Until the [Core Wemos D1 Mini](/pages/Core-Wemos.html) and [Core-ESP32](/pages/Core-ESP32.html) boards,
    this was my go-to building block for field units and other layout automation tasks.
