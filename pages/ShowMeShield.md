    Features
      * increased board size from 5cmX5cm to 3.5"x2" - small size cut into Arduino header pads, now room for small breadboard
      * moved LEDs outside of headers, allowing visibility even if board is in middle of a shield stack
      * added a reset button because one on Arduino will be hidden by the wide wings on this board
      * This version was fabricated and assembled by SeeedStudio and used as Arduino Introduction meet-up handouts I hosted
