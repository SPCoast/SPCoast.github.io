title: New Version
---
Whenever I

-   Send a board out to get Fab\'d,
-   want to experiment with some new parts, designs or layouts, or
-   significantly change the schematic,

I create a new VERSION of an existing project by

1.  Opening up the \"old\" project files in Eagle and then
2.  Using \"Save As\"
    1.  Create a new version-numbered sub directory under the project\'s
        top level umbrella directory,
    2.  Copy the older version\'s schematic and board files in it as a
        starting point.
3.  Immediately update the version info found in both the schematic and
    on the PCB silkscreen to reflect the new values.
