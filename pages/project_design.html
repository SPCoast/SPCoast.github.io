If you google("EagleCad"), you will find many articles about making
PC boards.  Most focus on one or two details - how to place parts,
draw traces, and, for the adventuresome, how to make simple parts
libraries.  What they don't tell you is why you should do things a
certain way, what you should do first, and how to make your PCB
design experience easier in the long run.  For that, you need to
dig deeper into CAD support forums, email threads and out-of-the-way
blog posts.  You might even (shudder) read the very useful documentation
from CadSoft!  I've tried to collect some of that wisdom here for
my own sanity; maybe it will help your's as well :smile:.

A little bit of structure is a good thing.  When working with PCBs,
repeatability and correctness are keys to success.  This workflow
(and the tools I've written to support it) help take the time
consuming "make work" out of the process, and lets me focus board
design.

The problems I'm trying to solve with this workflow are
* I've got dozens of different board designs, most with several revisions each.  Other than the sheer volume of coffee table coasters that implies, keeping track of them shouldn't be a nightmare. 
* In order to fix bugs in board designs - or to fab more copies of the good ones - I need to be able to reference the source files (sch, brd...) for EVERY fab run
* I don't design boards full time, so I need simple actions, scripts and tools help me "do it the right way" every time
* I want to be able to come back to a project after several years and figure out what I was doing, and
* I want to easily share things with others - and yet not spend all my time updating web pages.
