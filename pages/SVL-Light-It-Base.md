## Documentation

Like other NCE trinkets, the LightIts need infrequent servicing.  They need to be reprogrammed, they burn out, they get stuck and need some TLC...
Rather than crawling under the layout trying to find them, this mounting panel lets us put them in one easily serviced place, and allows easy
replacement without having a wiring mess.
