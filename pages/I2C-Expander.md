overview: >
    
    This board can host either the MCP23017 or PCA9555 SO package chips.
    The difference in proice is slight (~$0.50 or less), but the chips have slightly different programming and 
    features, which may make one more desirable.  Rather than support 2x designs, it is easier to have one.
    
    This is a 16-bit I/O board with 2x 8-bit ports: port0 and port1.
