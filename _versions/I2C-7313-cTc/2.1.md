overview: >
    
    Simple PCBs to help with taming the wiring ratsnest found behind a CTC machine's panels by concentrating the majority of LEDs and Switches directly on a PCB.
    
    
    The [I2C-8574-cTc](/pages/I2C-8574-cTc.html) versions are simple wiring-to-I2C adapters, these 2.1 versions are mounting plates for switches and LEDs as well.
