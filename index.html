<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Some of the schematics and PCB layouts featured here were done
using the free tools provided by <a
href="http://www.expresspcb.com/">ExpressPCB</a>, which provides
high quality turnkey board fabrication and internet based ordering directly
from their tools. Most of my more recent projects have been done
with another, more powerful package called <a
href="https://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/overview">EAGLE</a>, which
also has a free version for hobbiests. The only drawbacks I’ve found
with <a href="http://www.expresspcb.com/">ExpressPCB</a> is the
cost (somewhat higher than others) and the closed nature of their file 
formats - there is no way to move the
schematic or PCB data into other tools such as Eagle.
</p>

<p>Since many of the designs presented here are based - at least
in part - on the designs posted by others on the ‘net, these designs,
schematics and PCB layouts are also being made available to the
model railroad community as Open Source Hardware. Feel free to
duplicate, derive or improve on anything you find here; if you end
up doing amazing things, I'd love to hear about what you've done!</p>

<p>I am not selling these boards, though several may be available
from the Model Railroad Control Systems (MRCS) <a
href="http://www.modelrailroadcontrolsystems.com/">storefront</a>.  The
schematics and board layouts are available to you for your own
use, so you can easily take the files referenced on these pages and
have your own boards manufactured. It takes between 2 and 4 weeks
(faster if you pay more) and in the end you get professional quality
boards.</p>

<p>The collection of hardware and software projects on this site
represents projects that show up on my layout or are "learning
experiences" and projects I've done for others. Enjoy!</p>

<p>My goal is to build an 'duino-based 
	<a href="/I2C-CTC-harness.html">Dispatcher cTc panel </a> with field units to prevent switch/points and signals from being operated in ways that would allow conflicting train movements. To that end, I've designed a few WiFi enabled Arduino compatible processor boards ( 
	<a href="/pages/Core-Wemos">ESP8266</a> and 
	<a href="/pages/Core-ESP32">ESP32</a>) and a set of I2C-based IO devices ( 
	<a href="/pages/I2C-8574-IO">dual 8-bit</a>, 
	<a href="/pages/I2C-7313">16-bit, 64 addresses</a>, 
	<a href="/pages/I2C-9555-IO">16-bit, 8 addresses</a>, 
	<a href="/pages/I2C-AD4DA">A/D and D/A</a>) that can interface to various layout devices, such as 
	<a href="/pages/IO4-IR-Detector-Active">IR detectors</a>, 
	<a href="/pages/IO4-QuadOD">Occupancy detectors</a>, Signals: 
	<a href="/pages/SignalMast-DualHead">Dual</a>, 
	<a href="/pages/SignalMast-SingleHead">Single</a> and 
	<a href="/pages/SignalMast-Dwarf">Dwarf</a>, 
	<a href="/pages/IO4-RelayDriver">relay drivers</a>, and
	<a href="/pages/IO4-Turtle">turnout controllers</a>.  These all can be combined to produce a control point:</p>
