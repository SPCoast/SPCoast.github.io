overview: >
    
    UPDATE 
    
    I ordered 10x boards from SeeedStudio
    I also placed a Mouser order for all the parts except for the LM317LD, which nobody has in stock and the 'duino headers, which I order from SAMTEK
    The board cost $4, the parts come to $30 + shipping.
    
    UPDATE
    
    The boards came in and I've built up one for testing - the LEDs and Loconet parts work, and I'm trying to understand the openLCB code...
