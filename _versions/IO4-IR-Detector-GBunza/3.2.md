tagline: IO4 Quad Optical/IR Detector baseboard
overview: >
    
    Derived from Geoff Bunza's SMA Detector, published in his column in MRH as "SMA23 – A New DCC & DC Car & Loco Detector – Differential Absolute Position Detector (DAPD)"
    
    This version eschews "small" in favor of a remote mountable IO4 baseboard that can be mounted near the point of use, and then use [sensors disguised as ties](/pages/IO4-IR-Detector-GBunza-Fingers.html) for the sensor electronics themselves.
    
    
    It has 4 independent optical detectors for high density applications.  4 Circuit Enhanced Optical Position Detector uses an Arduino ProMini (included) for its timing and de-bounce, so these parameters can be changed in software.
    
    
    The output is an open drain (2N7002) which can sink up to 115mA @ up to 48V.
    
    
    This design uses Geoff's self-calibrating detection circuit, so you
    don't need to adjust for ambient light level.  Note the circuit
    won't work in the dark unless you provide an infrared illumination
    source.  The supply voltage range is 5 volts and the the output is
    an open drain (2N7002) which can sink up to 100mA @ 48V.
    
    
    Geoff says:
    
      >  "Every so often one needs an absolute position detector, rather
      > than a block detector. The best I’ve used employ their own light
      > source, but older designs use Cadmium Sulphide (CdS) photocells
      > and depend on ambient light in the room. Both have driven me crazy
      > with their limitations. This article describes a new design, using
      > ambient light “seen” by the detector in two places – typically
      > between the rails and just to the side of the track. When it
      > notices the track light level fall below the level of the second
      > sensor, it “indicates” the presence of an obstruction (car or
      > loco). The beauty of this “differential” measurement is that it
      > operates over a very wide range of light levels, does not require
      > “aiming” to a target, needs no adjustments, and can be virtually
      > buried in ground covering materials."
