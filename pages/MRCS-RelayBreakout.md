## doc

Relays come in handy in many telephone applications.  This is an
inexpensive DPDT (2 form C) relay suitable for controlling 2A loads,
serving as a latch for lights and buzzers, providing a contact
multiplier etc.  The relays come in many voltage options from 3-48
VDC, so the board can be customized for many different applications.


This differs from the inexpensive "Arduino Relays" in that the
inputs are necessarily logic compatible and in that these are DPDT
whereas the "Arduino Relays" are typically only Single Pole Double Throw (SPDT).
