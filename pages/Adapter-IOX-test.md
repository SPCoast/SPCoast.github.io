overview: >
    Active Low LED test jig for debugging IOX outputs
    
    When initially setting up an IOX expander, or debugging an existing installation, it is
    useful to be able to see the I/O lines changing.  This board is similar to the CMRI Output Test Card,
    but the LEDs are isolated from the I/O lines, allowing them to show the status of both outputs and inputs.
    
    Build with pin headers and you can insert the tester into the machined headers on the IOX or cpNode boards.
