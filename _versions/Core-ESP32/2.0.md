tagline: Core Field Unit Processor board using an ESP32 Dev Board with Wifi, BLE and a small OLED screen
overview: >
    
    A platform to prove out the ESP32 environment (maybe with circuit python) as a field unit implementation platform,
    allowing the software stack to be generalized and possibly based off of interpreted text file based data structures rather than customized C++ code.
    
    
    ESP32 - Geekcreit dev board & SSD1306 I2C OLED, with 2x 8x8 LED Matrix displays for showing control packet info.
    
    
    The 1.0 version integrated OLEDs were poor quality in practice; 2.0 brings a different ESP32 with external OLED
    
    
    Unfortunately, it is BROKEN
    
    
      * I did not read all the notes - this version uses ESP32 pin 2 that also prevents use if pulled high.
      * App note:  [ESP32 Boot Mode Selection](https://github.com/espressif/esptool/wiki/ESP32-Boot-Mode-Selection)
