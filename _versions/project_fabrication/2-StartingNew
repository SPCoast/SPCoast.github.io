title: Starting a new project

Although it is boarderline sacreligious to say so, the CadSOFT manuals
and tutorials are a good starting point. Go ahead and take the time to
[read their

(pdf).

If you are really new to Eagle,
[SparkFun](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-install-and-setup-eagle)
has a great getting started tutorial.

Here is a process that I\'ve found to work well for my needs:

1.  In EagleCAD\'s console window,
    1.  create a new project folder with the name of your project
    2.  create a new folder under this new project called \"1.0\" for
        your first design
    3.  in the 1.0 folder, create a new Schematic with the same name as
        your project

    :   

        :   NewProject/

            :   

                :   1.0/

                    :   NewProject.sch

2.  open the schematic in theEagleCAD schematic editor, and add a FRAME
    \<br \\\>If you checked out the
    [Libraries](PCB-Design-howto#Libraries "wikilink") section in this
    guide, you will recall that it is a good idea to maintain a personal
    library of the components you use frequently. As you find yourself
    reusing a particular component (like a schematic FRAME), consider
    copying it to your library:
    -   First, open your library (from the Eagle console window or the
        editor\'s library menu)
    -   Then, in the Eagle console window, navigate to the library and
        component you want to copy
    -   Right click on the component, and click on \"Copy to Library\"
    -   That\'s it: the component is now copied into your personal
        library, where you can edit it, add alternate packages or, as I
        frequently do, delete unwanted or untested variations and
        footprints.
3.  Back in the schematic editor, work on your schematic
4.  When you have the bulk of your schematic captured in the editor,
    switch to the board editor. \<br \\\>It will ask if you want to
    populate the new board with the components from your schematic\<br
    \\\>say YES.
5.  Continue to the Work on Project tab\...

New Revision {#new_revision}
============

Whenever I

-   Send a board out to get Fab\'d,
-   want to experiment with some new parts, designs or layouts, or
-   significantly change the schematic,

I create a new VERSION of an existing project by

1.  Opening up the \"old\" project files in Eagle and then
2.  Using \"Save As\"
    1.  Create a new version-numbered sub directory under the project\'s
        top level umbrella directory,
    2.  Copy the older version\'s schematic and board files in it as a
        starting point.
3.  Immediately update the version info found in both the schematic and
    on the PCB silkscreen to reflect the new values.
