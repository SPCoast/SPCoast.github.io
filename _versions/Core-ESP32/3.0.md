tagline: Core Field Unit Processor board using an ESP32 Dev Board with Wifi, BLE and a small OLED screen
overview: >
    
    A platform to prove out the ESP32 environment (maybe with circuit python) as a field unit implementation platform,
    allowing the software stack to be generalized and possibly based off of interpreted text file based data structures rather than customized C++ code.
    
      * Uses the [30-pin (2x15) "DEV" package](https://www.ebay.com/itm/313026496469)
      * Includes [C/MRI RS485 interface card](https://spcoast.github.io/pages/CMRI-Bus-Interface.html) IO connection
      * Supports I2C OLED: 1306 based 128x32, 128x64...
