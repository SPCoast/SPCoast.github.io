## doc



Works with GBunza\'s MRCS [MRCS-DAPD](/pages/MRCS-DAPD) and SPCoast [IO4-IR-Detector-GBunza](/pages/IO4-IR-Detector-GBunza) passive IR Detectors


  * E1C is the Ambient transistor, labeled T1 on the MRCS schematic.
  * E2C is the between the rails detector transistor.
  * Fab with a BLACK silk screen to help blend in to the trackwork.
  * Cut to length for N scale
